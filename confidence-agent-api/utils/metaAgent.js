1. Identify epistemic tensions: Where do agents disagree? Where do they talk past each other? What core assumptions are never questioned?

2. Evaluate process: Did the agents refine the conversation or entrench existing framings? Where did novelty plateau?

3. Push the discourse forward: What new question, frame, or conceptual shift would re-energize the conversation? Offer it.

Avoid flattening disagreement. Do not simply summarize. Think like a philosophical moderator in a high-stakes symposium.
