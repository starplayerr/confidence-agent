# Agentic AI Discourse: Multi-Perspectival, Confidence-Aware Artificial Councils

**A framework and prototype for pluralistic, council-based AI reasoning.**

---

## Overview

This project implements the "agentic council" paradigm: instead of a single-answer oracle, AI responses are generated by a council of diverse agent-personas, each embodying a different epistemic style and confidence level. These agents deliberate, disagree, and synthesize, surfacing nuance, uncertainty, and collective wisdom. The system is designed for structured, multi-perspectival discourse—enabling richer, more transparent AI reasoning.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Persona Diversity:** Agents differ by temperature (risk tolerance), epistemic style (grounded, speculative, artistic), and cognitive archetype.
- **Deliberation Mechanism:** Agents engage in structured rounds—divergence (tension-seeking), convergence (synthesis-seeking), and meta-analysis (pattern recognition).
- **Meta-Reflection:** A meta-agent synthesizes, critiques, and pushes the discourse forward.
- **Output Structuring:** The system surfaces disagreement, epistemic risk, and consensus, rather than collapsing to a single answer.

## Monorepo Structure

- **confidence-agent-api** — Node.js + Express backend for routing prompts to OpenAI, managing agent rounds, and meta-synthesis.
- **confidence-agent-ui** — React frontend for user input, council configuration, and interactive display of multi-agent discourse.

## Philosophy

> “Disagreement is not failure but generative tension.”  
> This project draws from philosophical traditions of deliberation, consensus, and pluralism. It is released as a public good, inviting open exploration and co-authorship. The goal is not to dominate, but to seed a new field of council-based AI reasoning.

---

## Use Cases

- AI governance and alignment deliberation
- Ethical exploration of unknowns (bioethics, synthetic biology, etc.)
- Scenario simulation under moral uncertainty
- Ideation and synthesis in research, art, and philosophy
- Educational tools for epistemic humility and pluralistic reasoning

---

## Configuration

By default, this system is set up to use OpenAI's GPT models via the OpenAI API.  
To use the API, create a `.env` file inside the `confidence-agent-api` directory with the following content:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
```

If you wish to use a different LLM provider, you can adapt the backend code in `confidence-agent-api` to route requests to your preferred model or service.

---

## Running Locally

**Install dependencies and start the API:**
```bash
cd confidence-agent-api
npm install
node index.js
```

**Install dependencies and start the UI:**
```bash
cd confidence-agent-ui
npm install
npm start
```

## Contributing

We invite the public to:
- Prototype new agent archetypes and discourse modes
- Test and refine council deliberation protocols
- Use this system in public or educational discourse
